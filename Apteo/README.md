# Work With Apteo

Because of a non-disclosure agreement with Apteo, I am not permitted to post samples of code I have written for them. However, some techniques I worked with include:

- Web Scraping in Python
- Automation using the Selenium webdriver
- Parsing data using lxml
- Integrating data into the company's SQL databases
- Integrating the code with the existing codebase

Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions about my work there with Apteo.
