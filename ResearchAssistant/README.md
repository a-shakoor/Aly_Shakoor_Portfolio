# Research Assistant

## My work as a research assistant for Dr. Tarkeshwar Singh, Department of Kinesiology at the University of Georgia. For the most part, I worked in MATLAB and made use of many elements of the PsychToolbox package.

I was tasked with developing an interface to test the motor reations of Parkinson's patients under visual stimuli. Specifically an object would cross the screen, and based on its shape, the patient would decide whether to move the joystick to move a shape that would meet the crossing object. 

Concepts used in my development included:
- implmenting a Graphical User Interface utilizing elements from PsychToolbox, including moving shapes.
- implementing the driver for the joystick
- pulling from mathematical functions like uniform/normal distributions and distance formulas to calculate velocities, orientations (coordinate system)
- adjusting to meet specifications of the Primary Investigator
