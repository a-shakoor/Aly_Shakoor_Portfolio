# Custom ArrayLists

We were tasked at making our own ArrayLists by creating two custom implmentations of the generic GenList interface. Below is an exercept from the project description:

"In this project, you will be providing two different implementations of a generic GenList interface, which defines different operations that one should be able to do with a generic list. A list is simply an object that represents an ordered collection of elements. The list implementation can decide how the elements are stored internally so long as users are able to interact with those elements via the methods defined in the interface. In this way, a list is an example of an abstract data type (ADT). To put it another way: while the implementor needs to undertand the specific details of the implementation (in order to write the code to make it happen), the user of a list does not. The users simply interact with objects of the list implementation through the methods defined in the interface."
